== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

== Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint|Motivation
| _SOLID_ | Used to store the personalized maps and information in personal pods that the user provides. Also to decentralize the personal data of the users.
| _Map Genericity_ | The implementation of the maps must be generic, the main implementation is for an specific place but you can used the application where you want.
| _Version Control_ | We will use a public repository in Github with different branches. The master branch is where the final application will be. In the develop branch we will have an usable application but not a finish version. All the other branches are use to individual work.

|Constraint|Motivation
| _Time_ | We have some deadlines that we have to stick to. The final project must be complete before the end of April.
| _Size of the team_ | The team is made out of four people, we all have other projects and assignments so some times it could be difficult to meet or have a lot of time for the project.
| _Experience_ | None of us has any experience in any of the technology we are going to use.
