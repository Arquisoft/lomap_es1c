.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

| Risk | Description | Measure 
| Big Project and Time | Being a large project compared to the projects we have done so far, the magnitude and the time we have are two of the things that we need to have in mind. | Being aware of the time, deadlines and also, have a good atmosphere in the team, solve the problems we encounter and  support each other during the development.
| SOLID knowledge and usage | The project uses the SOLID technology, called PODs, to store the data that the user uses in the application, this is a new technology that we need to understand and use. Also, we are very susceptible to changes in the SOLID technology that can cause bugs | Read the documentation and see examples of the usage of SOLID. Trust that SOLID works properly and we have the methods to control those errors and notify  them. 
| Usage of new technologies | As well as SOLID is something new for us, we also are using other technologies that we never used before | This can be mitigated with some experience that we will gain when developing the application, reading all the available documentation that we will need and seeing examples
