== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

----
Actor User
Component LoMap
Database pod as "Pod"
User -right-> LoMap: Interacts With 
LoMap -right-> pod: Store/Get Data
User -right-> pod: Owns
----

Motivation::
LoMap is an application that has a system where users can add custom places to the map. All the private data the application needs its stored in his personal POD.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header"] 
|===
| Name | Description
| User | The user that interacts with the application.
| LoMap | The main application that is develop to be used by the user.
| Pod | Personal POD of the user where the data is stored. 
|===

=== Level 2

[plantuml, "level2", png]
----
Actor User
Component mp as "Map Provider"
Component LoMap{
  Component wb as "WebApp"
  Component ra as "RESTAPI"
}
Database pod as "Pod"
User --> pod: Owns
User -down-> wb: Interacts With 
wb -right-> ra: Consumes
ra -right-> pod: Store/Get Data
wb -up-> mp: API service

----

Motivation::
We need to know how the LoMap service is built internally. As we see in the diagram we show the difference between the part of the application where the user interacts, and the part of the application that manages the data.  

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header"] 
|===
| Name | Description
| RESTAPI | The place where the data is managed.
| WebApp | User interface of the system that the user uses to interact with the application. 
| Map Provider | API that provide as the map interface for the main application.
|===

=== Level 3

[plantuml, "level3", png]
----
Actor User
Component mp as "Map Provider"
Component LoMap{
  Component ra as "RESTAPI"{
    Component sc as "Session Controller"
    Component ac as "Authentication Controller"
    Component fc as "Friend Controller"
    Component lc as "Location Controller"
    Component rc as "Routes Controller"
  }
  Component wb as "WebApp"{
    Component Login
    Component Logout
    Component Map
    Component AddPlace
    Component DeletePlace
    Component EditPlace
    Component FriendsLocation
    Component AddRoutes
  }
}
Database pod as "Pod"
User --> pod: Owns 
User -down-> wb: Interacts With 
wb -right-> ra: Consumes
ra -up-> pod: Store/Get Data
wb -right-> mp: API service
----

Motivation::
 To study in more detail how the WebApp works, that is the part that user interacts with, and also the REST API, the manager of the data.    

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header"] 
|===
| Name | Description
| Login | Page of the application where you can login.
| Map | Main page where the map is display and the user can interact with.
