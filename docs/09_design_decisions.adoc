== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision

| Design Decision | Pros | Cons
| React | A useful library widely used in large companies with lots of facilities and examples. It is an easy library to learn and also makes user interface development easy. It also has high compatibility with SOLID technologies. | It is the first time we use this technology, it is easy to learn to use it, but it is difficult to master it. In addition, official documentation is missing.
| JavaScript | We have previous experience with this technology, and it allows us a lot of freedom in development in combination with React | The freedom it provides can also be a major drawback, as it can cause weird errors with type handling. Also, it can cause some problems when reading new code developed by other members of the group.
| GoogleMaps | It is a free library that has a lot of customization and facilities for the map, we also have previous experience with it | Although it is free to use, it is limited to a time and uses, so if it is going to work for a long time, we will have to pay.
