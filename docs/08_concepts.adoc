== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Main architecture
The main architecture of the application is an MVC. 

=== Privacy
One of the main goals of the entire application is the privacy of the users. For this we use SOLID technology called PODs, which stores data and the user decides the privacy of the data. Users can enter the app by login with their POD provider.

=== User Interface
We use the React library in combination with JavaScript for the front-part of the application. The user interface should be simple to use, have a clean appearance and be easy to navigate.

=== Internationalization 
The application is developed to be used by many people who can use different languages, because of this the whole app can switch the language between Spanish and English.
